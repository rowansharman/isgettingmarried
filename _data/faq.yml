- question: Bears?
  answer: |
    They don't often come through town, and if they do they don't engage with people. If you see one, leave it alone and stick together. If it starts coming near you, make a lot of noise!

- question: Mosquitos?
  answer: |
    It varies by year. I, Charlie, react to them REAL BAD and apparently taste delicious, but I haven't felt a need to wear netting in town or on the beach. One step in the woods, though, and I have no skin exposed.

- question: Sunlight?
  answer: |
    It's pretty bright in Gustavus in the summer, but not Arctic Circle bright. Google says it'll be around 18 hours of functional daylight. Bring a good sleep mask!

- question: I'm trans. Is there a bathroom for me?
  answer: |
    There isn't an official gender neutral restroom at the GCC, but we're planning on putting up temporary signage so the "women's" and "mens" will be "stalls" and "stalls + urinal." We got you.

- question: Is there Uber/Lyft in Gustavus?
  answer: |
    No. But don't worry, much of Gustavus is walkable, most of the lodging options offer shuttles to and from the airport and the ferry terminal, and we will arrange other transportation (there's the possibility of a school bus in the works that may or may not have headlights and folding chairs)

- question: Are there restaurants?
  answer: |
    Sort of! Things aren't always guaranteed, but the Sunnyside Cafe should be open (it is under new ownerhip this summer, so no one is sure what it will be exactly). The Fireweed Cafe will be making coffee and serving sandwiches (made by the same person who will be catering our wedding). There is another restaurant at Four Corners that may or may not be open. The Cottonwood Cabins <i>might</i> have their restaurant finished and open. The Glacier Bay Lodge has food for its guests, but that's 10 miles away from town.

- question: Are there grocery stores?
  answer: |
    There is one grocery store! The merch will look very familiar if you've ever been to Costco. ToshCo is our fairly complete albeit not always fresh grocery and hardware store. It has the basics (dry goods, some produce, snacks, toiletries) but don't expect a lot of options. Expect to pay a little more as most of it is purcased from Costco, trucked to Gustavus on the ferry, and broken down into less Costco-sized quantities.

- question: Is there a pharmacy?
  answer: |
    There isn't! Be very extra sure to bring your meds and not lose them!

- question: What should I wear?
  answer: |
    It's pretty moderate in the summer, in the 60s. Bring layers and prep for rain or shine. As of early January, my personal prediction for the weather in June is that it will be somewhere between 50° and raining and 70° and sunny.

- question: What kind of shoes should I wear?
  answer: |
    Our venue, the Gustavus Community Center (GCC) has requested that everyone wear socks or indoor shoes inside. Expect lots of dancing on Sunday night, so keep that in mind! You will be able to leave your indoor shoes at the GCC all weekend. Otherwise, tennis shoes will suffice, but bring something sturdier and more mud-resistant if you want to go adventuring.

- question: I have an allergy or dietary restriction, can you accommodate me?
  answer: |
    Yes! Get in touch with us ASAP, so we can make sure you are able to eat!

- question: Can I take pictures?
  answer: |
   Please keep your phones pocketed during the ceremony, but take as many as you’d like otherwise. We'll have a professional photographer as well. Please don't post on social media ❤️
