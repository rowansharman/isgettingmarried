      <h1>Getting to Gustavus</h1>
      <p>
        There are three ways to get to Gustavus from the Real World.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg">
        <h2>The Jet</h2>
        <p>
          The simplest way to get to Gustavus is to just continue your commercial airline reservation right to GST. Alaska Airlines flies into our airport once a day in the summer. The jet arrives from Juneau a little before 5PM, after one of the shortest commercial airline routes you can book, at just 41 miles and about 13 minutes in the air. It then departs at around 5:30 back to Juneau. JNU -> GST is Flight 157 and GST -> JNU is Flight 77.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg">
          <h2>The Ferry</h2>
          <p>
            The ferry is an excellent option as well. Ferries in Alaska are a little different than most other places. Ours operates on Mondays and Thursdays. The boat departs Juneau at 7AM, and docks in Gustavus at 12:45PM. It's a warm and comfortable ride though, and is a great opportunity to see the Southeast Alaska from the water. It's not a tour boat, but you'll see sea otters, birds, and lots of trees and hills and mountains and cool stuff like that. It departs Gustavus at 1:30PM and arrives in Juneau at 7:15PM. It is cheaper than other options, but will most likely require you to spend at least one night in Juneau. You can check out the <a href="https://dot.alaska.gov/amhs/" target="_blank"> AMHS website</a> for more information and bookings, but as of this writing they have not posted their summer schedule yet, so the information above is subject to change. There are always tickets available, even day-of, so don't stress about booking too much in advance.

          <div class="col-lg">
            <h2>The Air Taxis</h2>
            <p>
              The air taxis are the most flexible and also most expensive option. It's about a 30 minute flight from Juneau in a small plane with around a dozen people. They operate several times a day between Gustavus and Juneau. On a nice day (about a 50% chance in June), they are also a stunning flightseeing experience. As of this writing, <a href="https://www.flyalaskaseaplanes.com/destinations/Gustavus/" target="_blank"> Alaska Seaplanes<a> has a monopoly on the Gustavus air taxi scene, which is why prices are high.

                Lodging for this many people in Gustavus is going to be tricky. We are going to try to organize as much as we can and then reach out to you to tell you where to book. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out!

              <h1>Juneau</h1>
              <p>
                In getting to Gustavus, most of you will find yourselves in Juneau for at least a little while. If you need to spend the night there, there are a handful of hotels in "The Valley" near the airport and the ferry terminal. Most of them offer free shuttle service to both the airport and the ferry terminal. Ride sharing services are spotty in Juneau, but there are several taxi companies that are reliable in the summer. Note that "Downtown" is a 20-minute or so drive from "The Valley".
