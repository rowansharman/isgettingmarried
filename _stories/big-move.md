### The big move

Then Nikita got into medical school – in Chicago.  Chris, being
the true Californian that he is, barely knew where Chicago was.
So when Nikita suggested they continue their relationship
long-distance, he unknowingly acquiesced.  How hard could it be?
He soon discovered that Chicago was indeed a great distance away,
but neither the distance (nor the cold) stopped him from visiting
Nikita as she buried herself in medical school at UIC. After 2½
years of flying back and forth (oh the miles!), Chris finally took
the plunge and moved to Chicago to be with his girl.  Slowly but
surely, they built a life together in Chicago – exploring the
city’s amazing restaurants, running through Millenium Park, and
investing in Chris’ first winter coat. Soon enough, Chicago felt
like a second home.
