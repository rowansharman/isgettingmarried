## Our Story

Chris was a Southern California boy who ran cross-country, attended
an all-boys Catholic high school (shenanigans ensued), and
perfected his image as the “chill smart guy”.  Nikita was a
Midwestern girl, a dancer, musician, and hopeful writer who
embodied every stereotype of the over-achiever.  A pair of
acceptance letters brought them together to that special place
between the foothills and the bay – Stanford University.  But they
didn’t meet until nearly a year later, when Nikita’s Indian
dance co-captain and Chris’ then-roommate introduced them. Love
at first sight it was not, but after a rocky start Chris
realized that this girl was too special to let go.  Nikita,
being the precocious person she is, had long since come to the
same conclusion. They happily embarked on the adventure known
commonly as The College Relationship.
