### The college years

As they progressed through their college years, Chris studying
computer science and Nikita the Classics, they grew up together.
They reveled in their mutual silliness, embraced each others’
friends as their own, and danced late into the night at parties
Chris would DJ.  They faced the typical challenges – Nikita
studying abroad in Athens, Chris working long hours on
computer-sciencey projects - but they found that facing them
together was more fun than going at it alone. By graduation,
they were inseparable. After getting their diplomas, Chris dove
into the startup world of Silicon Valley while Nikita finally
faced the fact that she could no longer rebel against her dreams
to be a doctor.  They lived happily side-by-side and explored the
Bay Area, which they both came to love.  All was well.
