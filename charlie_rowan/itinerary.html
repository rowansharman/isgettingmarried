<center><b><p>Gustavus is pretty small and has relatively few ammenities. It can be hard to get around without a car, it's uncertain whether/how many restaurants will be open, and there are a limited number of ways to even get there. With that in mind, we have come up with a kind of template itinerary for most folks, have a local caterer hired to feed people for the weekend, and have reserved the Gustavus Community Center (GCC). </p>
  <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: GCC has requested no outdoor shoes in the building, so please bring a pair of comfortable indoor shoes (unless you're comfortable spending a lot of time on concrete in socks).</p>
  <p>LOCAL NOTE: We're very excited to see you all on Sunday, and if you see us around at the GCC beforehand please don't hesitate swing by and say hi! We've hired Gustavus's very own Therese Nicol to make sure our out-of-town guests don't eat all the food in Gustavus and she'll be operating out of the GCC all weekend. Unfortunately she can't feed all of Gustavus and we need to give her some precise numbers, so we ask that you join us only for the big potluck dinner on Sunday (where Therese will still be providing a delicious main course!).

  </p>
  <p>Here's how we envision the weekend!</p></b></center>

    <p>This is your chance to see Glacier Bay! We recommend taking the Glacier Bay Lodge's tour boat (see <a href="/charlie_rowan/activities">Things to Do</a>). It's an all day sort of deal. They give you lunch. We'll figure out transportation to/from Bartlett Cove. No rush to book. Prepare for glaciers and puffins.</p>
    <p>Wedding prep and sandwiches at GCC for those who aren't on the boat. Dinner at GCC.</p>

    <p>You should have the lay of the land by now and be able to figure things out. Most people will probably leave on AK Air 77 around 5 pm.</p>
    <p>We're sure a lot of you will want to extend the trip on one end or the other, so check out <a href="/charlie_rowan/activities">Things to Do</a> for some tips.</p>
